          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            Kuilsriver Care Village, also known as AGS Kuilsriver Tehuis, has
            been a pillar of compassionate care in our community since 1976.
            Originally founded as a hospital, we transitioned into a specialized
            nursing home, driven by the growing need to provide dedicated care
            for the elderly. As a non-profit organization, our mission is to
            enhance the quality of life for every resident, offering a safe,
            supportive environment where they can thrive.<br /><br />
            At Kuilsriver Care Village, we provide personalized care programs
            that are tailored to meet the unique needs of each individual,
            ensuring that residents receive the attention and support they
            deserve. Our facility is equipped with a dedicated sick bay for
            medical care, ensuring prompt attention for any health-related
            concerns. We pride ourselves on our team of professional and
            compassionate staff who are skilled in medication administration and
            elder care, fostering both physical well-being and emotional
            comfort.<br /><br />
            In addition to our core services, we recognize the importance of
            spiritual nourishment and community engagement. Weekly church
            services are held on-site, providing residents the opportunity to
            participate in meaningful spiritual activities, regardless of their
            physical limitations.<br /><br />
            Though our primary focus is on delivering quality care, we are
            actively working on expanding our online presence to reach more
            families in need of reliable elderly care services.
